# rock-paper-scissors

Practiced creating functions using variables and logical operators with conditionals to create a rock-paper-scissors game between a player and computer. 

Used Javascript to manipulate the DOM to create elements and add styles to the UI of the rock-paper-scissors game. Event listeners are tied to buttons so that players can make a choice by clicking a button instead of typing their choice.
